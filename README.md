# Superstore-Business-Performance-Analysis
Measuring business performance is a way to assess your current market, access new customers and find new business opportunities. In this project, I will analyze the performance of the US-Superstore business by reviewing sales, customer, and product overview.
Here the dataset I used was dummy data that I got from the bootcamp platform: MySkill. The dataset represents the number of transactions in Superstores in the US (dummy-dataset) during 2015 to 2018, including its features allowing viewing of orders from multiple dimensions: from sales, discount value, order_date, delivery date, product details and customer information.
As I began this project I took into consideration the cycle of a data analysis project : Business Issue Understanding (set up objective and research queation), Data Understanding, Data Preparation, EDA , Visualization and Analysis and Insights.
